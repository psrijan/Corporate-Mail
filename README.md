# Auto Email:

This is a concept project about sending auto email. The project was inspired by a problem that I face. 
I find it very difficult to remember peoples birthdays. However, I also wish to reach out to my friends and family in their
best of moments and wish them. 

To resolve this problem, I wanted to make a system, that would automatically reach out to people during birthdays and festivals,
once I set details about what message to send to them. 

In it's current version, the system, only sends out messages through email, the primary reason for this is because emailing service 
out of other services (such as whatsapp, direct message, viber) is free and programming for it won't cost me money. However, changing 
the implementation from one service to another would only mean making another service layer that processes and dispatches data for 
the particular phyical service (ie whatsapp). Implication of which is that we can change the service layer, depending on the actual service 
messaging system and still have most of the code reused.


The application of this project could be in making
1. Auto Alert systems 
1. Corporate Email and Notification System (which is what I've named the repository)
1. Notification and Reminder Systems
